2) Folder strcture would be 
   
    src/test/java
> 
         CucumberFramework
> 
             FeatureFiles
 
                 <keep feature files here to be created as per 
                    requirements>
               
             StepDefinitionClasses

                  <code related to functions to be performed for verifying the feature file functionality goes here>
                  
             XPATH
                  <Xpath files per page of the application>
3) The feature file would be 
       weeklyForecast.feature
               
       Feature: User should get 5day weather forecast displayed when entered city name 
   
       Scenario: Get 5 day forecast for desired city.
               
       @Given ("User navigates to https://openweathermap.org/forecast5 site")
               public void user_navigates_to_site throws Throwable
                  
       @When ("selects city name")
       @Then ("Weather forecast for 5 days for the city should be displayed")                

4) Actual java code for each step would go in Step file 
5) XPATH of the web elements per page would be stored in separate folder hierarchy in .XPATH files.
